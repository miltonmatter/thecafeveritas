About Café Veritas

Café Veritas exists to engage, inspire, question, and enlarge our view of true life together by exploring tough questions and the relevance of Jesus Christ to all of life. Through lectures, interactive workshops, film discussions, and artistic performances, we seek to foster honest dialogue and thoughtful commentary that is characterized by excellence, humility, and grace.

Veritas is Latin for "truth."
