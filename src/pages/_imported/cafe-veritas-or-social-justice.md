As We forgive: 

Genocide, Forgiveness, and Reconciliation. 

What has Rwanda to do with Harrisonburg?

December 11, 2011

At Court Square Theater

Film Screening

with Response Gerrit Wolfaardt

How do we forgive the people who hurt us? Could you forgive the person who murdered your family? We will watch and discuss the student Academy Award-winning documentary As We Forgive which tells the story of two Rwandan women on a journey to reconcile with the neighbors who slaughtered their families during the 1994 genocide.

In the 1970s, Gerrit Wolfaardt was a white supremacist South African Afrikaner who avidly supported apartheid. Reading Alan Paton's beautiful book, Cry the Beloved Country, initiated a profound journey of change. Eventually, Gerrit left his law practice in South Africa to defend black South Africans. Over the past several years, he has worked in Rwanda with business, church, education, government, and healthcare leaders to implement practical reconciliation initiatives in order to nurture stable and thriving communities.
