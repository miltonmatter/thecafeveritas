Agriculture

Agriculture includes farmers and all who work the land. This includes orchardists, winemakers, and those who provide food for the table. Because this area affects us all and how we eat, it is important to have a genuine regard for the earth, its resources, and this process.  

Healing the Land: 

One Bite at a Time

February 20, 2012

At [Court Square Theater](http://www.valleyarts.org/cst/)

Featuring Joel Salatin & Aubrey Spears

What do farmers and academics, republicans and democrats, vegetarians and meat lovers have in common? Food. Our food habits not only effect our bodies, but also have profound affects on the land. Farmer Joel Salatin, and theologian Aubrey Spears have a discussion on healing the land one bite at a time.  

Joel Salatin is an author, self-described environmentalist, capitalist, lunatic farmer and the proprietor of [Polyface Farms](http://www.polyfacefarms.com/). 

Aubrey Spears is the Rector of the [Church of the Incarnation](http://theincarnation.org/) and a Fellow in Practical Theology for the [St. George's Centre for Biblical and Public Theology](http://www.stgeorgesonline.com/centre/).
