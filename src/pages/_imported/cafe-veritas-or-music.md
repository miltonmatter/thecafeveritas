Music

Music helps us dance. It is a pursuit for beauty and truth. It is full of creativity, skill, and depth of imagination. How should we listen to music? What impact does it make on our lives?

Listening to Music in a Culture of Distraction

December 3, 2013

At [](http://web.harrisonburg.k12.va.us/thms/)the [Lounge of Clementine Cafe](http://clementinecafe.com/rubys-lounge)

Featuring Ken Myers

In his 2007 commencement address at Stanford University, poet Dana Giola, a former chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, told his audience, "I worry about a culture that bit by bit trades off the challenging pleasures of art for the easy comforts of entertainment." This Café Veritas was a presentation from cultural critic and former NPR editor and producer Ken Myers on why our habits of treating music merely as a sedative or stimulant is preventing us from receiving some of the greatest gifts of beauty and wonder.

Ken Myers is the former arts and humanities editor for [NPR, Morning Edition](https://www.npr.org/programs/morning-edition/) and the Founder, Producer, and Host of [Mars Hill Audio](https://www.marshillaudio.org/).
