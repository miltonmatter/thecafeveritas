The Death of Democracy?

Christianity, Politics, and the Possibility of Hospitality

Matthew Kaemingk

Wednesday March 20, 2024  

7pm at Court Square Theater, Harrisonburg

It feels like America is being torn apart by deep political and cultural differences. In this public lecture, Cafe Veritas will offer a surprising claim: our differences are not, in fact, a threat. The true threat is our response to those differences. Christianity can help us to honor the rights, dignity, and freedom of those with whom we disagree—even those we find dangerous. Our aim for this Cafe Veritas is to help our city become a more hospitable space for those who deeply disagree, a place where we can talk openly and honestly about their own concerns and questions.

Bridging Our Divides:

Pluralism, Religion, and the Challenges of Polarization in American Democracy

MATTHEW KAEMINGK & SHADI HAMID

Thursday March 21, 2024

2:30pm  

Wilson Hall at James Madison University

We’re excited to present this conversation at JMU, a partnership between Café Veritas, the Philosophy and Religion Department, and the Madison Center for Civic Engagement. The event will include presentations and a moderated discussion between Matthew Kaemingk and his friend Shadi Hamid, with Christie Kilby and David Kirkpatrick (professors of religion at JMU). Kaemingk, an evangelical Christian teaching at Fuller Theological Seminary, and Hamid, a committed Muslim writing for The Washington Post and The Atlantic, received a grant from the Templeton Foundation to research Christian and Muslim approaches to deep political and religious difference. The discussion will first highlight American political polarization and the ensuing crisis of American democracy. Then Kaemingk and Hamid will contend that a deeply rooted faith is one of the best resources for addressing our current challenges. This event is open to the public.

Parking is available in the Mason Street parking deck on levels 3 - 5.
