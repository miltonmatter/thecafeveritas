Ordinary Sight:

Encountering Reality through art

Bruce Herman, Ed Knippers, Ken Myers

April 13, 2023

7:00 - 8:30pm

Church of the Incarnation, Harrisonburg

The way we see the world and each other has been transformed – literally and figuratively – by the internet, by phones with cameras, and by the abundance of screens. But has the overwhelming proliferation of images in our time really enabled us to see things more fully, or more truly?

On April 13, Café Veritas will host an evening of conversation with two painters who will consider the nature of seeing and understanding. Bruce Herman and Ed Knippers have spent many years looking at, reflecting on, and presenting the ordinary things of the world, in ways that can transform our vision extraordinarily. Join them and cultural journalist Ken Myers at 7:00pm as they consider how to encounter reality through sight.

Reflections:

A closing reception for  Magnificat

August 24, 2023

7:00 - 8:00pm

Church of the Incarnation, Harrisonburg

Join Café Veritas for an evening celebrating Bruce Herman's paintings and the blessing they have been to our city! Local artists and historians will provide a series of brief reflections on the Magnificat paintings, with a reception following. Let's enjoy these sublime works together once more before we send them off at the end of August!

Bruce Herman

Bruce Herman’s art has been shown in more than 150 exhibitions — nationally in cities including New York, Boston, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Houston — and internationally in England, Japan, Hong Kong, Italy, Canada, and Israel. His artwork is featured in many public and private art collections including the Vatican Museum of Modern Religious Art in Rome; The Cincinnati Museum of Fine Arts print collection; The Grunewald Print Collection of the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; DeCordova Museum in Boston; the Cape Ann Museum; and in many colleges and universities throughout the United States and Canada.

Herman taught at Gordon College for nearly four decades, where he held the Lothlórien Distinguished Chair in Fine Arts for more than fifteen years.

Herman completed both BFA and MFA degrees at Boston University College of Fine Arts under American artists Philip Guston, James Weeks, David Aronson, Reed Kay, and Arthur Polonsky. He was named Boston University College of Fine Arts Distinguished Alumnus of the Year 2006.

Edward Knippers

Edward Knippers is a figure painter who has held over 200 awards and exhibitions throughout North America and Europe. His work can be found in numerous public and private collections including The Vatican Museum, Armand Hammer Museum, and the University of Oklahoma. He has been featured in numerous publications including LIFE, Christianity Today, The Critic, The Washington Post, Image Magazine, The Washington Times, and New American Paintings.

Mars Hill Audio writes of his work, "In his fleshy portraits of biblical characters, Knippers attempts to capture the reality and mystery of the human body without reducing it to a wooden object or exalting it to the status of an idol. Knippers insists that physicality is a gift from God that must be appreciated but not worshipped."

Ken Myers

Ken Myers did his first radio interview in 1972 when he was 19, working in college radio. His first guest was Johnny Cash. Although he wonders at times whether he peaked early, Myers insists that sociologists, historians, psychologists, and even economists can be just as interesting as country music singers.

Myers established Mars Hill Audio in 1992, after having worked as arts and humanities editor for NPR's Morning Edition, as well as on editorial projects with Richard John Neuhaus and Charles Colson. The mission statement of Mars Hill Audio commits the organization “to produce creative audio resources that encourage Christians to grow in obedient wisdom concerning the cultural consequences of our duty to love God and neighbor.”
